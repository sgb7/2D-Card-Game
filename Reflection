Milestone 1 Reflection

  This milestone was pretty easy overall, I’d say, since we were just following along with the tutorial, but it helped in 
getting me a little more familiar with Unity and how it works. I’m still not one hundred percent confident in my skills with 
it, but getting some experience with it with this assignment—and the labs we’ve been doing—has been a really good starting 
point.
	The only problem I really ever had, which I found out a lot of other people also had, was the whole sizing issue whenever I 
worked on computers with different sized screens. That was always a little annoying. Manageable, but annoying. I mostly just 
tried to stick with one kind of computer after I figured out the cause, so I wouldn’t have to deal with it. The solution that 
was eventually found did seem to work though, when I gave it try, so there’s that.
	That small issue aside, it’s been cool working with Unity to make all these little games. The card game tutorial had a pretty 
simple end result, so I’m particularly looking forward to making it into something more playable like Blackjack; I’ve even 
already had a couple ideas about how I might implement it. I think working everything out and getting it running will be fun.
